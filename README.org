* HELIX

[[https://travis-ci.com/vzaliva/helix][https://travis-ci.com/vzaliva/helix.svg?token=x87izvm44MdTPLHzuxzF&branch=master]]

HELIX project allows for the synthesis of high-performance
implementations of numerical algorithms by providing a certified
compiler for formally-specified DSL.  Based on the existing [[http://spiral.net/][SPIRAL]]
system, HELIX adds the rigour of formal verification of its correctness
using the Coq proof assistant. It formally defines a series of
domain-specific languages starting with HCOL, which represents a
computation data flow. HELIX works by transforming the original
program through a series of intermediate languages, culminating in
LLVM IR.

- HELIX focuses on automatic translation a class of mathematical.
  expressions to code.
- It works by revealing implicit iteration constructs and re-shaping
  them to match target platform parallelism and vectorization
  capabilities.
- HELIX is rigorously defined and formally verified.
- HELIX is implemented in Coq proof assistant.
- It supports non-linear operators.
- Presently, HELIX uses SPIRAL as an optimization oracle, but it
  certifies its findings.
- LLVM is used as machine code generation backend.
- Main application: Cyber-physical systems.

** Example

   An application of HELIX to a real-life situation of high-assurance
   vehicle control [[http://spiral.ece.cmu.edu:8080/pub-spiral/abstract.jsp?id=281][(paper)]] using a dynamic window vehicle control
   approach [[https://doi.org/10.1109/100.580977][(paper)â€‹]] is shown below:
